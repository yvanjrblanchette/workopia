# What Is Laravel?

Laravel is a popular open-source PHP web framework designed for building modern, scalable, and secure web applications. It is an opinionated and a high-level framework. I'll talk more about what that means in a minute. It also follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern, which we'll get into later, and it  aims to make the development process more efficient and enjoyable. 

I'm sure most of you are aware of what a web framework is, but just in case you aren't, it's a collection of libraries and tools that help developers build applications faster by providing common functionality, such as routing, database management, and authentication. If you took my PHP from scratch course and create the Workopia project, then you know that just using PHP can be a bit cumbersome and repetitive and even messy. Laravel and frameworks in general make things much easier and more organized.

Laravel was created by Taylor Otwell in 2011 and has since become what I would say the most popular PHP framework. It's known for its expressive syntax, robust features, and active community. Laravel is used by developers around the world to build a wide range of applications, from simple blogs to complex enterprise systems.

Usually when people learn PHP, they go in one of two directions. They either learn WordPress or they learn Laravel. Wordpress is more for smaller content-based websites and blogs, while Laravel is for more complex applications. And there is nothing that says that you can't learn both.

## Opinionated Framework

Laravel is an opinionated framework, which means it comes with a set of conventions and best practices that guide developers in building applications. This can be a good thing because you usually get a ton of features right out of the box, it helps maintain consistency across projects and makes it easier for developers to collaborate. However, it can also be restrictive if you prefer more flexibility and control over your code.

If you have ever used Ruby On Rails, Django or Angular, then you know what an opinionated framework is. There are a lot of features and conventions. If you have used Express.js or React, those are very unopinionated frameworks where you don't need to do things a certain way. You have a lot of freedom, but you also have to make a lot of decisions and don't get many out of the box features. There are pros and cons to both approaches.

There are so many more features, but these are some of the key ones that make Laravel so popular. In the next video I will give you a large list of the features and libraries that are come built in to the framework.
