# Section Intro

In this section, we're going to talk about how to set up our development environment. We'll start off setting up our text editor. I'll be using VS Code, however you're free to use whatever you'd like. I do want to go over a couple VS Code extensions though that will help you out when it comes to things like autocomplete and code highlighting.

Then we'll talk about some of the different ways to setup both PHP and Laravel. Obviously you need PHP installed locally to run Laravel. We'll also be using a PostgreSQL database. You can install everything separately but there are also software suites that include all that stuff for you. I'm going to give you a few options and talk about each one, but ultimately I'm going to use a tool called Laravel Herd, which sets up and configures PHP and Laravel in a couple clicks. It's cross platform and I'll have a video showing you how to get setup on both MacOS and Windows. 

For those of you that don't want to use Laravel Herd, I'll also be showing you how to install it using the Composer dependency manager. You'll need to install Composer either way, so make sure you watch that video if you're not familiar with it.
