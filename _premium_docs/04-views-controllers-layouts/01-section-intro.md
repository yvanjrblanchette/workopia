# Views, Controllers and Layouts

We setup our Laravel app and we learned how to take in requests through a route and send a response back. Now we are going to get into views, which are the pages and UI of our project. We will be using Blade templates for this as well as certain directives for dynamic data and things like conditionals and loops. 

 We'll also be working with controllers. We have been working directly in the routes closure, but usually your routes will pertain to a specific controller class and a specific method. So we will have a Job controller with a bunch of methods for different tasks. From our controllers we can load views and pass in data. We'll also look at using layouts with template inheritance and partials. So that we don't have to repeat ourselves and have things like the html, head and body tags in every one of our views.

 We can also use Type Hinting in Laravel, so we will look at how that works as well.
