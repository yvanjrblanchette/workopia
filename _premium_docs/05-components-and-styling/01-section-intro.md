# Components & Styling

In this section we're going to start to put our UI together. So the way that we setup our layout and used partials is kind of the old way of doing things. Instead of partials, we want to setup our UI with components. This works in a similar way to frontend JavaScript frameworks like React. We'll have a header component, a hero component. We're even going to make the navigation links components. And these components can be passed props, which are basically custom attributes. Again, if you've worked with something like React, this will be a very familiar concept. We'll learn about slots, which are another way to make the components dynamic.

We're also going to setup Tailwind CSS because we'll be using Tailwind classes for our styling. We'll be adding a tiny bit of frontend JavaSript for our mobile menu toggle, so we'l also learn how to use public assets like Javascript and CSS files as well as images.
