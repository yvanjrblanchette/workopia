# PostgreSQL Windows Installation

In this lesson, I will show you how to install PostgreSQL on Windows.

Go to the [official website](https://www.postgresql.org/download/windows/) and download the latest version of PostgreSQL, which at this time is 16.

Download the installer and run it.

Keep everything selected including PGAdmin4 which is a graphical user interface for PostgreSQL. It makes it easy to manage your database and run queries.

It will ask you to create a password for the superuser. Enter what you want.

Keep the port at 5432.

Choose your language. Click next and install.

You don't need to select Stack Builder. This includes a bunch of other software that you don't need.

Now you have PostgreSQL installed and running on your computer.

Open PG Admin and we will continure in the next lesson.
