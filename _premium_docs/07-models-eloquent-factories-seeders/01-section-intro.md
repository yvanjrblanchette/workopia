# Models, Eloquent ORM, Facroties & Seeders

We now have our database setup and connected to our application. Now we need to start interacting with it. Remember, in MVC, the model, the M deals with the database. We've already been working with routes, controllers and views, now it's time for models. Laravel comes with a great ORM called Eloquent, which has all kinds of methods to work with the data. Methods like find, create, paginate, update, delete and many more. So we don't really create model methods. We already have them available to us. We can also have relationships between models. We're going to create a relationship between users and job listings.

We're going to setup to fetch job listings and we're going to add some listings using Tinker, which is a command line tool where you can essentially run any code you would in your controller. We'll look are forms and input validation within controllers and then we're going to do a bunch of stuff with factories and seeders. This allows us to fill our database with sample data in a single command. This section will help you get to the next level in Laravel development.
