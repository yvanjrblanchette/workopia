# Dashboard, Profile & Pagination

Now we're going to start working on the dashboard, which will have 3 different things on it. It will have the user's job listings with buttons to edit and delete. It will have a form to edit the profile info including name, email and avatar. Then later, when we add application submissions, it will have the applicants under each listing. So we'll start on the user listings first. 

Another thing that I want to do in this section is add pagination on the jobs page. If we have 500 listings, we obviously don't want to fetch or show all 500 at once. That would be horrible for performance. So we will implement pagination as well as customize the look of it.
