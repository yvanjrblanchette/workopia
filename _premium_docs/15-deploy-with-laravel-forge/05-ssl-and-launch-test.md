# SSL & Launch Test

Now we need to add an SSL. We can get a free SSL with Let's Encrypt via the Forge interface. Log into Forge and click on "SSL". Select "Let's Encrypt". It will take a minute or so and then it should say active.

Now go to your domain name in the browser and it should work. If it doesn't just wait a while. It can take anywhere from a few minutes to 48 hours, but it is usually very quick.

Now just go through and test the following:

- Register user
- Login user
- Upload an avatar
- Add a job listing
- Edit listing
- Bookmark listing
- View saved listings
- Remove bookmark
- Apply and upload resume
- View appllicants on dashboard
- Delete applicant
- Delete job listing
- Log out

That's it! Our application is done and deployed.
